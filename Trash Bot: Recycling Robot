#"Trash Bot" is a waste management system that combines computer vision, deep learning, and path planning techniques to efficiently sort and classify different types of waste. Implemented in the CoppeliaSim simulation environment with a robotic manipulator, the system uses 3D models of various waste items like bottles, cans, plastic covers, paper, and pens, created and textured in SolidWorks. These models are displayed in various orientations on a conveyor belt to enrich training data. The system also features a convolutional neural network model developed to classify and segment the waste into distinct categories including plastic, paper, metal, glass, and cardboard, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of waste management.
